# Antimicrobial-Peptide-AMP-Predictor
Machine Learning module that leverages the power of machine learning to predict the anti microbial activity of a dataset of Anti Microbial Peptides (AMPs).

Antimicrobial peptides and proteins (AMPs) are natural occuring class of molecules, that form part of the innate immunity found universally in all living organisms, thus playing the role of first-line defense against the invading pathogens. Currently, over 800 different antimicrobial peptides have either been identified or predicted from from their nucleic acid sequences.

These proteins have a broad range of activity, and can act to directly kill bacteria, yeasts, fungi, viruses and even cancer cells. Thanks to their diverse function and architecture, they have attracted the attention of several scientists across the world seeking to understand the immune system, and AMPs could be leveraged as tool in the design of molecular templates for new anti-infective drugs.
